# CS6190---ProbabilisticMLProject
This repository is about CS6190 probabilistic machine learning project. Here, we have taken a small dataset of medical images (~230) and used two probabilistic approaches, GAN and VAE to generate more realistic images to increase the umber of samples which plays significant roles in deep learning based methodologies.
